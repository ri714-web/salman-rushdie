    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Sir Salman Rushdie is one of the most celebrated voices in contemporary literature. Known for his dazzling use of magical realism, he has redefined postcolonial writing by weaving together myth, memory, and history. His works explore how nations remember and misremember their pasts, how personal and collective trauma shapes identity, and how storytelling itself becomes an act of survival. Rushdie’s writing captures the contradictions of migration, exile, and cultural hybridity, making him a pioneer of literary responses to the postcolonial condition.</p>

<!-- Biography Section -->
<section id="biography" class="content-section">
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Salman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, just two months before India’s independence and Partition—events that profoundly shaped his imagination and later became central to his writing. Educated at Rugby School in England and later at King’s College, Cambridge, where he studied history, Rushdie began his career in advertising before turning to fiction.</p>
    <p>His breakthrough novel, <em>Midnight’s Children</em> (1981), catapulted him onto the global literary stage. It combined magical realism with a deeply political narrative, chronicling the birth of independent India through the eyes of Saleem Sinai, a child born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947. The novel not only won the Booker Prize but also set the tone for his lifelong exploration of history, memory, and trauma through fantastical storytelling.</p>
    <p>Rushdie’s career has also been marked by controversy, most notably after the publication of <em>The Satanic Verses</em> (1988), which led to global debates about blasphemy, censorship, and freedom of expression. Despite this, Rushdie has continued to write prolifically, producing novels, essays, memoirs, and works of criticism that consistently engage with questions of cultural identity, migration, and the power of narrative.</p>
